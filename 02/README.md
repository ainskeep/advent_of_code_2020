I got stuck on the difference between `re.match` and `re.search`. In an effort to remember the difference here, 
I'm making myself write out the difference.

### re.match
match only works if the match is found at the beginning of the string
only returns the first occurrence of the substring

### re.search
search looks for the whole string.
only returns the first occurrence of the substring
